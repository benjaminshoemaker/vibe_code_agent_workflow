I want to create an app that provides, on the right rail, a chat interface, and on the left side, a set of documents (collapsible) that represent outputs from a series of conversations in the chat. The chat will guide the user from an initial idea description, to an idea one-page, to a dev spec, to a prompt plan + manual steps that can be implemented by an AI coding agent and its user. The chat will use a series of prompts that facilitate the generation of each of those artifacts. This is a webapp, primarily, that can be used on mobile as well. The ideal customer is a semi-technical founder who wants to create using AI coding tools. The problem is solves is that incomplete specs, or specs that are not specific & broken up enough, are not well implemented by coding tools.
